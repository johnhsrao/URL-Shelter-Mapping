# URLShelterMapping
  
  This codebase includes the grasshopper script and demo data for Urban Risk Lab emergency shelter mapping project. This script computes an occupancy plan that maximizes the number of residents for emergency shelters following COVID-19 social distancing guidelines. To run the script, the user would load a demo excel file or any excel sheet that specifies the number of people in each group/family by setting the file path for the ExcelRead component then set the ComputeMapping and Visualize boolean toggles to True. Users may set custom design paramters such as the input shelter space, ciculation path widths. 
   Detailed documentation of the project can be found at http://johnhsrao.com/project/shelter-mapper
